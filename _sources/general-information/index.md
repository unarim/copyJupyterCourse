# **Welcome!**

Hello and welcome everyone to the introduction page for the course **Creating interactive content with Jupyter Books** created as part of [DigiTeLL](www.uni-frankfurt.de/digitell), by the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/intro.html) project. Our project aims to provide open and free educational resources to promote key digital skills for working in empirical sciences. 

As you read through the subsections of this website, you will gain insight into how to create beautiful, easy-to-deploy, and interactive content quickly. Simply follow the outline discussed in the [Course Overview & Procedure section](overview) to learn what this course is about and how to navigate the materials.

While this tutorial was created with the goal of an integrated framework for digital education at Goethe University, this doesn't limit the content to members of Goethe University: We utilize free, open-source software available to anyone.

## What Is the Aim of This Course?
In this online course, we first want to emphasise the benefits of free and accessible online courses and why they should be of interest to lecturers/trainers. Then, you will learn how to create your own free online resources for higher education using our course template. 

## How Did We Get Here?
We believe that education should be available to as many people as possible, which is why this website is created as an open and free resource; if you'd like to create a course following our framework, please consider doing the same. Especially important should be the inclusion (and possibly adaptation) of our diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, our open science statement, and the Code of Conduct to promote fair and inclusive access to education. 

## The Goal of Our Project

The DiLER project aims to create a framework for providing, bundling, and introducing the benefits of free, open-source resources for promoting research-based learning, with a focus on the core competency of "digital literacy" in empirical sciences. This is done through multimedia, competence-oriented content, and exams that cover the entire empirical research process, using examples from various requirements of psychology studies. 

Our project places a strong emphasis on promoting sustainability and transferability to other content and application areas, supported by integrated feedback options for students and teachers, and incorporating necessary hardware and software infrastructure. The project also primarily follows the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets) in order to maximize the benefits and accessibility of provided materials.

As traditional educational models are often insufficient in conveying the intricacies of digital literacy, this project aims to empower course instructors to take advantage of interactive, flexible, and open-source resources to enhance their teachings.
