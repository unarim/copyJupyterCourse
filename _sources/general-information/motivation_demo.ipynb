    "# Motivation: Why Are We Here?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your educational resources were not only effective for today‚Äôs students but also **accessible, citable, and reproducible** for future generations? If this prospect aligns with your academic vision, we invite you to explore this approach further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the ongoing replication crisis, many universities are striving to make research and education more **open, inclusive, and FAIR** (*Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable*). However, conventional educational platforms such as Moodle, OLAT, and ILIAS present significant limitations that are often at odds with these objectives. These proprietary systems introduce several challenges, including restricted access, high costs, and limited interoperability. For instance, educators frequently need to acquire costly licenses, which can hinder their ability to develop and disseminate instructional materials freely. Moreover, these platforms often lock users into specific ecosystems, complicating collaboration across institutions and disciplines. These constraints inhibit the dynamic and interactive learning environments necessary for contemporary higher education and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges of Proprietary Educational Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional educational platforms present several key issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content is often exclusive and accessible only to a limited group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaboration on learning materials is constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Citability of learning resources is often inadequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content must frequently be recompiled for each new cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integration of interactive elements is cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content may become fragmented across multiple course iterations, making it difficult to track and update over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Alternative Approach: Open Educational Resources (OER)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we propose the adoption of **Open Educational Resources (OER)**. \n",
    "But how can these be effectively created and maintained? \n",
    "Our approach leverages open-source tools, including [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), along with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), to facilitate the development and dissemination of reusable educational materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarity with these tools is not required‚Äîwe will provide a structured introduction within the next 90 minutes. Our methodology is supported by a [**pre-configured template**](https://github.com/DiLER-Digitell/Course-template) designed to simplify the creation of OERs. This template can be used for diverse learning materials as well as for dynamic publication and documentation (for an example, click [here](https://oreoni.github.io/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our approach offers concrete solutions to the limitations outlined above:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content is **openly accessible** to anyone with an internet connection, independent of institutional affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration** is greatly facilitated through GitHub‚Äôs **version control** and contribution mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Educational resources become easily **citable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Materials can be **reused** and **adapted efficiently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version control** ensures that previous iterations remain **accessible**, enhancing **transparency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks support seamless integration of **interactive components**, including **live coding, videos, and presentations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hosting content via GitHub allows for **centralized management** and **continuous tracking of updates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This framework aligns more effectively with the principles of open science and FAIR research than conventional approaches***.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Jupyter Books?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Book is a powerful, **open-source** tool that enables you to create and publish **interactive**, **web-based textbooks** and other educational content. It is built on open-source technologies such as Jupyter notebooks, which allow for easy integration of **code**, **text**, and **media**, providing a more immersive and engaging learning experience. By leveraging the power of open-source technologies, Jupyter Book addresses the limitations of proprietary software and provides a customizable and adaptable solution for modern education. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multimedia integration\n",
    "In addition to the limitations of traditional means of education, the modern world's diverse population requires educational methods that cater to a range of learning styles and abilities. Multimodal educational means, which utilize a variety of media and techniques such as **audio**, **video**, **images**, and **interactive elements**, are essential for engaging learners with different learning styles and abilities. These methods allow for greater customization and adaptability, enabling learners to progress at their own pace and in a way that suits their learning style. As such, multimodal educational means are critical for providing an inclusive and effective learning experience for all students, regardless of their background or ability level.\n",

    "- Recognize the utility of GitHub Pages for educational dissemination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehend how these tools streamline the creation of OERs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appreciate the long-term benefits of adopting this methodology for academic instruction and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing Course Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "All course materials will be **freely available** on this course website, ensuring **unrestricted access in line with the principles of open science**. Participants are encouraged to explore, enhance, and disseminate these resources. The materials will remain available indefinitely, subject to updates and revisions. To preserve a specific version, the complete course can be downloaded from our GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "A course template will also be provided to facilitate practical engagement. This template includes a structured folder system, example content files, a licensing framework, an open science statement, an equity, diversity, and inclusion statement, and a code of conduct. It serves as a foundational tool for creating personalized courses. By incorporating custom content and adjusting the structure as needed, participants can deploy their own educational resources through GitHub with minimal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "We invite you to engage with these materials and begin transforming the way educational content is created and shared.\n",
