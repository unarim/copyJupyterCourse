    "Open science is a movement that aims to make science, research and data accessible to everyone, with the goal of improving transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, as well as equality in the scientific community/academia. Open science further often involves the aim to establish best research practices and to develop tools and infrastructure to support sharing data, scientific output and educational ressources.\n",

    "Several open science statements have been developed by various organizations, institutions, and groups to promote open science practices. Some of the most commonly referenced open science statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration): The Berlin Declaration is one of theone of the milestones of the Open Access movement. It advocates for open access to scientific research and was signed in 2003 by representatives of research organizations, universities, and funding agencies from around the world.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Open Science for the 21 st century](https://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/OpenScience-Rome-Declaration-final_web.pdf): An declaration by all european academies, hosted by the European Federation of National Academies of Sciences and Humanities. Enshrines the aim of european countries to commit themselves to promote the practical applications of open science principles within their national arenas of activity, and to jointly advocate for their adoption in the international domain.\n",

    "[The mission statment of the center for open science](https://www.cos.io/about/mission):\n",
    "Constituting a vision of a future scholarly community, in which process, content, and outcome of research are openly accessible by default to everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many universities have additionally developed their own open science statements, e.g. \n",

    "\n",
    "[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/): The FAIR principles stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles aim to make research data more accessible and reusable by promoting the use of standardized metadata, persistent identifiers, and open data formats. Allowing research not only to be shared, but also to be actually found.\n",
    "\n",
    "[TOP guidelines](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines): The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines were developed by the Center for Open Science to promote transparency and reproducibility in research. The guidelines provide a framework for researchers to enhance the transparency of their work, with recommendations for data sharing, pre-registration, and reporting standards.\n",
