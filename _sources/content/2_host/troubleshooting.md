# Troubleshooting

If, for whatever reason, the "pages and deployment" workflow fails, it will be marked with a red `x` instead of a green
checkmark.

Clicking on the failed workflow will reveal which process has failed, in this case, the "build" process.

Clicking on the process will reveal a detailed log of which part of the process failed. Debugging this can be quite unintuitive. 

Therefore, we will show you some common errors and solutions. If the recommended solutions do not work or your error is not mentioned, feel free to contact us either via opening an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on the [course template repo](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler) or e-mail and we'll try to get back to you ASAP.
