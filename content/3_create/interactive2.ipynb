    "`Interactive content` plays an important role in effective education. It encourages `active participation` and helps learners understand and remember what they‚Äôve learned more deeply. By combining media, such as text, images, audio, video, and interactive elements, you can offer a more dynamic and accessible learning experience. Interactivity also supports self-paced learning, allowing individuals to focus on the areas where they need the most practice. As a result, interactive content is a useful tool for keeping learners engaged and improving outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Go to [mybinder.org](mybinder.org)\n",

    "3. Click `Lauch` to test your environment\n",

    "The badge is a clickable image that opens the environment when clicked. You can add this badge to your Jupyter Book‚Äôs README or any .md/.ipynb file to give readers direct access.\n",

    "#### 2. Changing the `_config.yml`\n",
    "To make interactive buttons appear within Jupyter Book pages, modify the _config.yml file_ found in the lecture folder add the following bit of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```# Launch button settings\n",
    "launch_buttons:\n",
    "  notebook_interface        : \"classic\" # Or jupyterlab\n",
    "  binderhub_url             : \"https://mybinder.org\"  \n",

    "‚ùå __2. Not All Pages Need Interactivity__\n",

    "## A Better Practice: Use Standalone Interactive Notebooks for Specific Tasks üéØ\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of enabling interactivity across your entire course, a more effective approach is to __designate specific notebooks__ for interactive elements and place them exactly where they are needed. These notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Do not__ form part of the main course structure in `_toc.yml`.\n",
    "* __Do__ serve targeted purposes like quick demos, progress questions, or simulations.\n",
    "* __Live__ in a separate folder (e.g., `extras/`, `binder/`, or `interactives/`).\n",
    "* __Are linked directly__ from relevant sections of your course with explicit Binder links.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, readers can quickly launch the notebooks that require interactivity without cluttering or slowing down the entire book. It also provides a more __guided__ experience, focusing attention on the exact tasks that benefit from running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "* Quick demonstrations of key concepts\n",
    "* Self-paced progress questions\n",
    "* Short multiple-choice quizzes to reinforce concepts\n",
    "* Interactive simulations or visualizations\n",
    "\n",
