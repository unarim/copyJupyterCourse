# Setting Up a GitHub Account

First things first, let us set up a GitHub account. 

**1. Go to the GitHub website**: Open a web browser and navigate to the [github.com](https://github.com/).

**2. Click on the "Sign up" button**: The button is located in the upper-right corner.

**3. Fill out the registration form**: Fill out the required information and choose a username. Choose your username carefully, as your username will be included in the link to the website we're going to build and will be publicly displayed! Also, it is a good idea to associate your account with your university email address (if you have one) as this will entitle you to sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which comes with some nice free bonuses.

**4. Verify your email address**: Check your email inbox and click on the verification link sent by GitHub.

**5. Customize your profile**: Fill out your profile information. This will help others to find and connect with you on GitHub.

**And that's it!**
You can now use your new GitHub account to store your code online or collaborate and share your projects with the world!
